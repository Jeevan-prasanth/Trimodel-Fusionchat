# Trimodel-Fusionchat


---

Trimodel-Fusionchat is a project that integrates three powerful models to create a conversational chatbot with enhanced capabilities. The three models integrated into this project are:

1. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: This model enhances the chatbot's ability to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base, improving the quality of responses.
   
2. **Image Analyzer**: Integrated with the chatbot, this model enables the bot to understand and respond to queries related to images, providing a richer conversational experience.
   
3. **SQL Engine**: This component allows the chatbot to interact with SQL databases, enabling it to retrieve and manipulate data based on user queries.

## Features
- Conversational chatbot with advanced capabilities.
